Welcome to my website! Currently I am a research assistant professor in Department of Mathematics and Institute of Data Science at University of Hong Kong. Before that, I was a postdoc at Wisconsin Intitute for Discovery currently and lucky to work with Professor [Stephen J. Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). I received my PhD degree in Pennsylvania State University when I was fortunate to have Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](http://www.personal.psu.edu/vvs3/) as my supervisor and thesis advisor. My research interests include nonconvex, stochastic and robust optimization, with all types of applications. You may find more about me in my [CV](https://yue-xie.github.io/files/CV_YueXie_2021.pdf).

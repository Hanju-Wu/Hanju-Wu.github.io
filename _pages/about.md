Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at Wisconsin Intitute for Discovery currently and lucky to work with Professor [Stephen J. Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). Before that, I received my PhD degree in Pennsylvania State University when I was fortunate to have Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](http://www.personal.psu.edu/vvs3/) as my supervisor and thesis advisor. My research interests include nonconvex, stochastic and robust optimization, with all types of applications. You may find more about me in my [CV](https://yue-xie.github.io/files/CV_YueXie_2020.pdf).

Welcome to my website! I am a postdoc at Wisconsin Intitute for Discovery currently and lucky to work with Professor Stephen J. Wright. Before that, I received my PhD degree in Pennsylvania State University when I was fortunate to have Professor Uday V. Shanbhag as my supervisor and thesis advisor. My research interests include nonconvex, stochastic and robust optimization, with all types of applications. You may find more details about me in my [CV](https://yue-xie.github.io/files/CV_YueXie_2020.pdf).

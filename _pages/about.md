Welcome to my website! Currently I am a research assistant professor in HKU Musketeers Foundation Institute of Data Science (HKU-IDS) and Department of Mathematics at the University of Hong Kong. Before that, I was a postdoc at Wisconsin Intitute for Discovery and lucky to work with Professor [Stephen J. Wright](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/). I received my PhD degree in Pennsylvania State University when I was fortunate to have Professor [Uday V. Shanbhag](http://www.personal.psu.edu/vvs3/) as my supervisor and thesis advisor. My research interests are nonconvex, stochastic and robust optimization, with all types of applications including machine learning and data science. You may find more about me in my [CV](https://yue-xie.github.io/files/CV_YueXie_2022.pdf).

### I am hiring a postdoc at University of Hong Kong. Feel free to contact me (yxie21@hku.hk) if you are interested!
